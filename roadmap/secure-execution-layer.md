# Secure Execution Layer Roadmap

Status: active
Track: Phase 5 - End-to-End Governed Autonomy

## Milestone Mapping

Milestone: Phase 5 - End-to-End Governed Autonomy (open)

Linked open issues:
- #26 Phase-Gate Multi-Cycle Scheduler Spec v0.1
- #27 Autonomous Phase Transition Governance Spec v0.1
- #28 Recursive Self-Improvement Governance Spec v0.1
- #29 Self-Generated Governed Task Creation Spec v0.1
- #30 auto: governed improvement task 1
- #34 auto: recursive improvement 3

## Current deterministic scaffold progress

- [x] Pure policy conflict-resolution contract with explicit guardrails.
- [x] Review-ledger resolver contract validation at initialization.
- [x] Network egress deterministic conflict structure validation.
- [x] Secret injection mode tightening (no bearer mode).
- [x] Deterministic audit event taxonomy + chain validation scaffold.
- [ ] Execution Permit Attestation Contract v0.1 (spec prerequisite for runtime wiring).

## Next implementation boundary

- Remain in pure scaffolding mode.
- No supervisor wiring.
- No governance-core mutation.
- No runtime sink integration.

- [ ] Supervisor Permit Issuance Flow v0.1 defined (spec only). Runtime wiring pending.

- [ ] Policy-to-Capability Deterministic Mapping Contract v0.1 defined (spec only). Runtime enforcement pending.

- [ ] Controlled Runtime Enforcement Plan v0.1 defined (spec only). Runtime wiring pending.
