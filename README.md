# Local Autonomous AI Repository

This repository hosts a fully local, privacy-first autonomous AI workflow.

Principles:
- All memory is explicit and stored in Markdown
- No hidden model state
- Git history is the system’s long-term memory
- Agents are isolated but coordinated

Nothing leaves this machine unless explicitly pushed.
